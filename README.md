The Board Configurator app in nRF Connect for Desktop lets you update the
configuration of the board controller on some Development Kits from Nordic
Semiconductor. The board controller is the firmware running on the Interface MCU
that controls the behavior of the DK.

**Note:** Currently, the Board Configurator app is experimental. This means that
the application is incomplete in functionality and will change in the future.
